## Control Tower for AWS

If you want to run control-tower with it's own IAM account, create a user with the following permissions:
- AmazonRDSFullAccess
- AmazonEC2FullAccess
- IAMFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonVPCFullAccess
- AmazonRoute53FullAccess
- IAMUserSSHKeys

Run the container

        docker run --tty --interactive --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>' --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY>' --name control-tower cnservices/control-tower bash

## Control Tower for GCP

On GCP you must also ensure the following APIs are activated in your project:
- Compute Engine API (gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) API (gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com)
- Cloud Resource Manager API (gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
- SQL Admin API (gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com)

If using a dedicated GCP IAM member, a IAM Primitive role of roles/owner for the target GCP Project is required.

Run the container:

        docker run --tty --interactive --volume $(GCP_KEY_FILE_PATH):/tmp/ --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/$(GCP_KEY_FILE_NAME) cnservices/control-tower bash
